# water-quality-prediction-using-ML-algorithms-
we have done prediction using ML(Decision Tree,KNN,RandomForest,Logistic Regression) algorithms and predicted which algorithm is best for water portability
The aim of this study is the prediction of water quality components using machine learning algorithms. They are Decision tree classifier, Random Forest , Logistic Regression and K nearest Neighbor and find the water is portable for drinking or not
